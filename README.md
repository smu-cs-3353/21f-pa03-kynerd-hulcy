Problem: _given a graph, implement the Girvan-Newman algorithm to determine communities within the graph_

We implemented the Girvan-Newman algorithm according to the pseudocode provided in their paper, â€œCommunity structure in social and biological networks".
First, we calculated edge betweenness centrality for every edge in the graph using the Brandes algorithm. Following this algorithm, we implemented a breadth-first-search to determine the distance and number of shortest paths from each vertex to all other vertices in the graph. Then, the vertices were visited in reverse order from leaves to source by popping off a stack, and dependencies and centrality betweenness were accumulated.
Once edge betweenness centrality was calculated for each edge in the graph, edges with the highest betweenness centrality were removed until distinct communities were formed. 

We tested our implemenation using graphs randomly generated using Python's `NetworkX` library. Four subgraphs representing communities were created, and the nodes were connected within the community randomly with probability `p_in` and with other communities with probability `p_out`. We selected the values `p_in = .55` and `p_out = .04`, which yields an average node degree of 16 for graphs of size 128.

After running Girvan-Newman on the graph, the graph shows 4 distinc communities.

We tested our implementation with a dataset of college football teams, using the Girvan-Newman algorithm to determine each team's conference.
